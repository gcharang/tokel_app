## About

Tokel Platform is Komodo ecosystem's token platform.
It consists of :

- TOKEL coin wallet - release 1
- Token wallet
- NFT marketplace
- DEX

At the moment the app is in development of release 1.

For more information about the project please join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/QzWaDNd4N5) or check out [tokel web](https://tokel.io)

## Install

```bash
yarn
```

The application is using [libnspv](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/libnspv).


## Starting Development

We do not commit libnspv to the github coz git modifies the binaries, so you need to add binaries, seed folder and a coins file to `include/binaries/libnspv`. It should have the following structure. Ask about the current coin config for the chain in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/QzWaDNd4N5).

Setting for RPC port and the coin ticker name to connect to are in `src/vars/defines.ts` file
